                 <p>All elephants have several distinctive features,the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis,used for many purposes,particulary brathing,lifting water and grasping objects.Their incisors grow into tusks,which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging.Elephants' large can carry their great weight.African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
                 <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs,forests,deserts and marshes.They prefer to stay near water.</p><strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
