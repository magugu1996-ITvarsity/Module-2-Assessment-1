            <h3>TIGER</h3>
                 <p>Tigers are carnivorous mammals,and they mostly eat large prey like deer,wild boar and even elepjant calves.And yes,they have occasuinally been known to kill and eat people too.This usually only happens when a tiger is pld,ill or injured,and therefore unable to catch their normal prey.But once a tiger has a taste for human meat,they often have to be killed to protect the local people.</p>
                 <p>Tigers are the biggest cat in the wild,yes.male tigers can grow to over 3m long and weigh up to 3ookg while female tigers tend to be slim .</p>
                 <p>Tigers are relatively adaptable and historically lived across huge swathes of Asia.</p><strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
            <P>You will find the tiger at pen G52,right next to the ampitheatre</P>
